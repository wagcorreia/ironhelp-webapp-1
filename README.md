# Welcome to IronHELP!

This project is related to the lessons learned in module 2 of IronHack's web development bootcamp. The idea is to create a forum for students where they can post their questions. Behind that, during development we practice CRUD concepts, routing, and various React.js related tools like react-router-dom, axios and more.
